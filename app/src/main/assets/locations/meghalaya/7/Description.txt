The 4th most noteworthy waterfalls on the planet, Nohkalikai falls fall somewhere in the range of 335 meters from a verdant cliff to the ground giving the depiction of gigantic and extraordinary heavenliness. 
The pride of the territory of Meghalaya, the falls are one of the most wonderful and terrific falls in the nation.

Taken care of between the evergreen rainforest of the Khasi Hill and streaming with all its glory and may, the falls dive into a tidal pond which is as blue as the evening sky. 
This fall is one of the best places to visit in Meghalaya.

Speciality: A paradise-like destination with outstanding natural views.

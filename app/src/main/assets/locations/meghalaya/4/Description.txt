Situated in Cherrapunji, Meghalaya, a double-decker living root bridge is famous for its bridge made up of roots of an Indian rubber tree.
 The bridge is 3 km long at a height of 2400 feet. The most scenic experience is when the Umshiang river flows beneath the bridge and you are walking over it. 
It is the oldest natural bridge made around 200 years ago but only 50 people can be accommodated at one time.

The bridge begins at the town of Tyrna and crosses the Umshiang waterway during its adventure. Getting to the exact location is somewhat of a trek.
 The climb down to the bridge is an incredible 3500-3600 stages every route to the scaffold and once more from the base town of Tyrna, which is 20 kilometers from the principal town of Cherrapunjee. 
It is one of the top places to visit in Meghalaya.

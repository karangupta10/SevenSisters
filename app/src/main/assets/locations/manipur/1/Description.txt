Blessed with natureâ€™s bounty, Senapati is a simple yet intriguing hideout and one of the best tourist places in Manipur. 
Almost 80 percent of the area here is covered in verdant forests, and the rest of it is inhabited by villagers.
 The hamlet makes for an ideal escape for someone longing for a cultural insight to Manipur. 
You could be spending the day exploring the woodland and in the evening spend time with locals, who knows may as well cook something special for you.

Do not forget to visit India’s largest monastery in Tawang . 
It was a part of Tibet till the 20th century but now it is in the Indian city of Tawang. 
This monastery is known to be called Galden Namgey Lhatse which means the “celestial paradise in a clear night”.

Currently, it is the largest in the country but the second largest in the world. 
Arunachal Pradesh is truly a delight and it works so well in preserving its culture, its people, its flora and fauna. 
Apart from this, you cannot miss Bap Teng Kang Waterfalls and Nuranang Falls at all! 
The best time to visit Tawang is in April to September.

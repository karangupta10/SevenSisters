The Kaziranga National Park is home to two-thirds of the planet’s population of the one-horned rhinoceros.
 Apart from that, this national park is also a World Heritage Site and a major highlight on the Assam tourist places map. 
It’s vibrant, well preserved, sustained ecology, and versatile biodiversity is what contributes to keeping this place on the top of the list of tourist places in Assam.
 Other than the one-horned Rhino, the park draws its popularity from other pleasant surprises like the Swamp Deer, Elephants, Wild Buffalos, Chinese Pangolins, Bengal Foxes, Gibbons, Civets, Sloth Bears, Leopards, and Flying Squirrels to name a few. 
It’s also a tiger reserve since it houses an enormous population of the royal Bengal Tigers, making it one of the most important Assam points of interest. 
This is certainly among the best places to visit in Assam.
